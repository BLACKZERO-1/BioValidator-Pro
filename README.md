## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Synthesis Feasibility Monitor
* **GC Content Analysis:** Real-time landscape and distribution graphs.
* **Error Detection:** Automated scanning for homopolymers and repetitive regions that complicate DNA synthesis.
* **Visual Error Mapping:** Instant pinpointing of manufacturing bottlenecks on the sequence track.

### 2. Cloning Cockpit
* **Virtual Agarose Gel:** Simulates DNA migration on a 1% agarose gel with a 1kb ladder for size verification.
* **Restriction Skyline:** A professional "Lollipop Plot" visualizing enzyme cut sites, highlighting **Single Cutters** (Gold Standard) for cloning.

### 3. Ribosome Translation Simulator
* **Interactive Live Simulation:** Watch a virtual ribosome translate your mRNA into a polypeptide chain in real-time.
* **Chemical Accuracy:** Amino acids are color-coded by chemical properties (Hydrophobic, Polar, Acidic, Basic).
* **Codon Optimization:** Calculates CAI (Codon Adaptation Index) to prove expression gain (e.g., +45% efficiency).

### 4. Bio-Integrity Console
* **Threat Detection Log:** Scans for premature stop codons, Chi sites (instability), and strong hairpins.
* **Risk Density Histogram:** Visualizes "Danger Zones" where errors are clustered.
* **Genome Risk Map:** A dark-mode genomic track for high-precision hazard location.
